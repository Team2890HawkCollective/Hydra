//using either the .start, .execute, or .end commands depending on the situation.
//the autoTargetActivated is used to make it so that you cannot fire or drive

     * To Reader: 
     * 
     * If you extend this class off of RobotMap you will inherit
     * all of the variables from it; in other words clear up this 
     * code.  Extending it will not break anything, it will just
     * associate this class with the variables of the parent class.
     * Nothing in the rest of the code will have to change,
     * it will just make it so that you don't have to type 
     * RobotMap before everything.
